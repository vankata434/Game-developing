## Falling Rocks

-	Add rocks of different sizes and colours
-	Add dwarfs of different sizes and colours
-	Implement collision detection
-	Add falling power-ups - bonuses that help the player like shrinking the dwarf or speeding him up
-	Add levels to the game - it may be something as simple as increasing the speed at which rocks fall, decreasing the interval during which they spawn or slowing down the player
-	Implement an RPG-like skill system. Have the dwarf gain abilities like moving trough rocks, gaining speed, the ability to shoot down rocks, etc.  **[BONUS]**

## Asteroids

-	Add asteroids of different sizes and colours

-	Implement collision detection
-	Give the space ship the ability to shoot down asteroids

-	Give the player health / lives, allow him to survive more than a single hit with an asteroid
-	Add power-ups - bonuses that help the player like improving his fire power or speeding him up
-	Add levels to the game - it may be something as simple as increasing the speed at which asteroids come at the player, decreasing the interval during which they spawn or slowing down the player
-	Implement an RPG-like skill system. Have the space-ship gain abilities like moving trough rocks, gaining speed, etc.  **[BONUS]**

## Pong

-	Implement collision detection and make the movement more realistic - let the ball move in the Y direction as well.
-	Implement an artificial intelligence smart enough to play the game. It should have 2 modes:
	*	"Ralph Wiggum mode" - the AI randomly chooses a direction to follow
	*	"Lisa Simpsons mode" - the AI always follows the balls movement and cannot ever miss the ball
-	Add points to both player for scoring
-	Add obstacles in between the two players. The obstacles should have different materials that the ball bounces differently upon contact with. For instance,
hitting a stone wall may cause the ball to move in a direction opposite of the current, while hitting an wood wall opposite to the current on only one axis and
nevertheless a half-mirror may allow the ball to pass trough it when the ball is coming from the left and not when it's coming from the right.
-	Add multiplayer support
-	Add multiple paddles to the game (more players) - 3, 4 or 8. Add multiplayer support and AI for the new paddles. **[BONUS]**

## The "Platform kills things" game

-	Implement collision detection. Destroy blocks upon hit. Have the player lose whenever he misses the ball.
-	Create different blocks. Some blocks should be destroyed on a single hit, others may survive longer, third may be invulnerable.
-	Give the player abilities like shooting a second ball or increasing the length of his platform whenever he successfully destroys a special kind of a block.
-	Add levels to the game - it may be something as simple as increasing the speed of the ball, spawning new blocks or slowing down the player
-	Add multiplayer support for 2, 3 or 4 players to simultaneously control more platforms each having a different ball. Show ranking. **[BONUS]**
